# flutter_tv_master

Flutter TV Master Configuration.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter TV application. You can start your flutter tv app by cloning this template. Do not forget about Flutter Focus (References : https://medium.com/@omlondhe/keyboard-focus-in-flutter-d574a1b77d39) in order to save your time to manage your focusable widget.
